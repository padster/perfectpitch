# Perfect Pitch

Web app to help people try to learn perfect pitch.

UI is a local web app, everything in pure JS in the browser.

The app starts as a play button, when clicked it starts cycling through random notes.

When the user hears a note, the background is also set to a color based on the note, the note's name is shown, and an emoji for the note is shown.

There's also a slider that allows the user to adjust the tempo of the notes.
